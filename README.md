# ClearBrief Demo Project

Since I'm almost 6 months out of practice with JavaScript and React, I figured I'd get my head back into coding in JS/React by doing a quick little project to demonstrate my experience and skills. I took a look at the ClearBrief site and noticed there are a lot of heads/avatars on the main page. A common practice is to use cards and modals for profile-type UX, so I thought it would make sense to build out a quick app that shows a different style for displaying and interacting with the information the ClearBrief site displays about the team members. 

I started this in the morning and am just wrapping it up early afternoon. I think it demonstrates an understanding of dom manipulation, js itself, style and design, as well as attention to detail. If you have any questions please feel free to reach out. 

## Notes
My personal goal was: simple, elegant. I tried to reduce visual noise by creating space for elements and also add some interesting transitions that heighten the UX. I wanted to soften the feel of the page a little so I chose to use lighter colors with smooth gradients calm the effect on the eye. A design is just a design -- one of millions of possibilities for a layout and set of components that a user can interact with. This isn't perfect, and a lot depends on what the feeling is that the organization is trying to convey. I like trying to convert those sentiments into functionality and UX that meets both the needs of the org and also the eye of the user.
